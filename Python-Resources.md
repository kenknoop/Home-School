# Python and computer science for non programmers

If you're new to computer programming, python is probably the best language to start with. Following are short lessons and examples intended to supplement existing resources for new programmers and Python.

## Lists and Arrays, Vectors, Matrices and Sets

A Python list is the same thing as an array in other languages, like c/c++. Python lists are generally more convenient to use as they don't require memory allocation or specific typing.

A simple Python list is like your grocery list. It's a one-dimensional array. Entries in the list are indexed numerically from 0 to the number of entries minus one.

```
grocery_list=["cereal","milk","orange juice"]
```
